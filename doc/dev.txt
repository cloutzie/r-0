/initiate drop recording

bot says watching or something

person submits image

bot asks if thats it, if no, can post more pictures

if it is all, pytesseract to check what stage, how many runs, drops etc etc

bot says working

once done, return a table with data like runs, drops stage etc

ask if correct

if not, increase tolerance and try again

if not again, ask to manually change data

if yes, populate nosql

after that, fill google sheet with new data

very cool
